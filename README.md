# Wall Wreckers

Wall Wreckers is a game inspired by classic Atari game and is implemented in C++. In this game, players use a paddle to bounce a ball and break through walls of bricks, aiming to clear the screen and score points. If players fail to keep the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen, they lose the game. I made this game primarily to improve my understanding of C++ and Graphics Programming.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository using the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/helios2003/Wall-Wreckers.git
```
- Ensure that you have [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) in your system.
- Run the script ``run.sh`` using ``./run.sh``.
- The game window opens and you can enjoy the game.

## Key Bindings
- `Enter` to start the game.
- `>: Right Arrow` to move the paddle to the right.
- `<: Left Arrow` to move the paddle to the left.
- `LShift` to pause the game.
- `RShift` to resume the game.
